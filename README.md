# My attempt for Cole's Homework 1

## What I learned from this homework

I like this homework. The following is what I learned:

### Inserting image

```
<img src = "yourpig.jpg"/>
```

### Text

`<b>` for bold. `<em>` for italic. 

### JavaScript dictionary

JS dics are in fact an object:

```
aDict = {
    AL: 0.1,
    CA: 0.2,
    WI: 0.3
}
```

Then, we can access this way: `aDic["AL"]`

### Get value from an element by ID

```js
document.getElementById("yourid").value
```

### Event listener

```js
document.getElementById("yourclick").addEventListener("click", () => {
    alert("This is your message:" + afunction())
})
```
